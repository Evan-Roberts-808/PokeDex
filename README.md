## User Stories

<p>As a user, I will be able to navigate through the PokeDex to find more information on my pokemon of choice. I can directly search for my pokemon, or I can use the filters to narrow down my results and look through a list of pokemon. I can find more info on the pokemon by clicking on its element and getting a pop displaying its info. I will aso be able to add create a team by clicking on 6 of my favorite pokemon. This team will be stored in a database that can be accessed with the "Team" button. When viewing a pokemon's data, there will be an option to "Add to team". CLicking on this will add the pokemon to the roster. Once 6 pokemon are selected, any new pokemon added to the roster will remove the first pokemon to make room for the new pokemon. </p>
