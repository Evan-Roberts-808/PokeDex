## User Stories

<p>As a user, I will be able to navigate through the PokeDex to find more information on my pokemon of choice. I can directly search for my pokemon, or I can use the filters to narrow down my results and look through a list of pokemon. I can find more info on the pokemon by clicking on its element and getting a pop displaying its info</p>
